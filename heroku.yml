# This build manifest is present to provide the build time configuration (i.e. `MIX_ENV`) of a
# Docker image when built for a review app. The build manifest is not currently used for anything
# else as it is not used in the provisioning of Review Apps, visit:
#
#   https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-yml-build-manifest#review-apps-and-app-json
#
# It is important to note that the build manifest is not used when building a Docker image locally
# with `bin/heroku.docker.build`.
